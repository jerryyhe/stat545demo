# L8: Tidy Data

## Exercise 1

This exercise is from the STAT545 website under the Tidy Data module.

Your task:

1.  Form a small group with some of your neighbours.\
2.  As a group, spend about five minutes brainstorming how to reproduce the plots above, using only what we have learned so far about dplyr and ggplot2.\
3.  Did you hit a wall? Discuss as a group and see if you can put your finger on why bullet point #2 was hard.

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)

# Load data
drinks_tbl1 <- as_tibble(drinks)

# Pivot servings and alcohol longer into two separate cols
drinks_tbl2 <- drinks_tbl1 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = ends_with("servings"), names_to = "Alcohol", values_to = "Servings")

# Plot
drinks_tbl2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Servings)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(Alcohol)) + 
  ylab("Number of countries in each alcohol consumption group") + 
  xlab("Number of servings of alcohol consumed in 2010")


```
