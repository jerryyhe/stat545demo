# Authoring

## Intro to R Markdown and Markdown

Markdown is ideal for creating reproducible workflows. What this mean is that it is basically a workflow that makes re-running your analysis so simple that you can basically do it with one click.

We are going through basic formatting in a markdown file in the file `demo_markdown_file.md`

Also note, you can write comments that don't show up on the .html file with the following syntax:\
<!--- I'm a comment --->\
You should see an empty space above me.

## Writing PDF Files

Usually, you need a PDF writer such as LaTeX, but you we don't want to download it so we can use the R package "tinytex"

```{r}
#install.packages("tinytex")
#tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
